# Sexual Harassment Support Center Sentiment Analysis
## Project Overview
This project aims to harness the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve support services for survivors of violence against women and girls. By analyzing sentiment in text conversations from sexual harassment support centers, we develop a model to classify these interactions as urgent or non-urgent. This classification aids in prioritizing responses and tailoring support to the survivors' immediate needs.
